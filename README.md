**Disney+** has changed the game for how fans enjoy content from **Disney**, **Marvel**, **Pixar**, **Star Wars**, and **National Geographic**. With exclusive originals and blockbuster hits, it's no wonder millions subscribe. But here's the catch: **Disney+ content is region-locked**, and some movies or shows aren't available in your country.

In this guide, you’ll learn **why Disney+ restricts access**, and how you can **bypass those geo-blocks** to watch your favorite content **from anywhere in the world** using tools like **[9Proxy](https://the9proxy.short.gy/home-github-james2k4)**.

## Why Disney+ Content Is Region-Locked

Disney+ offers different content libraries in different regions due to:

- 📜 **Licensing Agreements**
- 🌐 **Local Regulations**
- 🎞️ **Distribution Rights**

For example, a Marvel movie might stream in the **US** but not be available yet in **Europe** or **Asia**. Disney+ uses **geo-blocking technology** to detect your **IP address** and determine your location. If you’re in an unsupported country, your access is **limited or completely blocked**.

## How to Access Disney+ Movies from Anywhere

To get around these restrictions, you need a tool that can **change your virtual location**—and the best way is through a **proxy or VPN**. Here’s how it works:

- 🛡️ A **proxy reroutes your internet traffic** through a server in a Disney+-supported country (like the US).
- 🌍 Disney+ sees the new **IP address** and treats you like a local user, unlocking the **full content library**.

### Why Use Residential Proxies?

Unlike data center proxies, **residential proxies** use **real IPs** from actual devices, making them **harder to detect** and less likely to be blocked.

That’s why I use **[9Proxy](https://the9proxy.short.gy/home-github-james2k4)**—a trusted residential proxy provider.
